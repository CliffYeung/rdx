1. do "perldoc rdx_pat.man" to see the man page

2. do "./rdx_pat.mk" to do the default builds.  there are three test builds with different defines:
   a. 8 nodes, 3 keys, 4 bytes per key
   b. 1 nodes, 1 keys, 1 bytes per key
   c. 500 nodes, 5 keys, 12 bytes per key

3. edit rdx_pat_search?.h - change the following lines:

      /* maximum number of data nodes stored in rdx trie */
      #define MAX_NUM_RDX_NODES  8

      /* number of rdx search keys */
      #define NUM_KEYS           3

      /* number of bytes in each key(s) */
      #define NUM_KEY_BYTES      4

4. do "./rdx_pat.mk" again to build and test with your own MAX_NUM_RDX_NODES, NUM_KEYS, NUM_KEY_BYTES values

5. do "./rdx_pat.mk clean" to clean the directory

6. the test code is identical for all three test runs.  some tests are not run in case 'b' above
   because of too few nodes.

7. all tests should run with gcc, clang or g++.  the g++ run gives warnings about being compiled
   with -std=c11 set.  this is ok.
